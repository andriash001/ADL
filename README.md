# Autonomous Deep Learning
This is the code of Autonomous Deep Learning. It is capable of constructing the network structure from scratch with the absence of user-defined parameters. The main file is ADL.m while the file for executing is run_ADL.m. There are four datasets provided here that is, electricity pricing, weather, SEA, and hyperplane. The main file ADL.m can be downloaded from this link https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335022278_ADL_Code.
This is also implemented in python, the code can be found in https://github.com/SeptivianaSavitri/adl_python.
